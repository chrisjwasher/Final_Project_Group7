# Final_Project_Group7
DATS6303 Deep Learning Group 7 Final Project for Speech Emotion Recognition

To do (Dec 1):
-	Finish SER models
  o	CNN, LSTM, ViT?
  o	Evaluate and compare performance
  o	Graphic for final presentation
-	Finalize multimodal model to incorporate pretrained text classification
  o	Incorporate additional datasets and align emotions to SER
  o	Literature review of best pretrained models
  o	Compare to best SER audio only model
-	Streamlit presentation
  o	Comparison of SER audio only models
  o	Comparison of best audio only model to multimodal model
  o	Demonstration with 1-2 audio files (take audio file as input?)
-	Final report
  o	Summarize model architectures for custom SER models
  o	Summarize literature review for text classification
  o	Summarize model performances
