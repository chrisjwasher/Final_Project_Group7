# Final_Project_Group7
DATS6303 Deep Learning Group 7 Final Project for Speech Emotion Recognition

To do (Dec 1)

Finish SER models
-   CNN, LSTM, ViT?
-   Evaluate and compare performance
-   Graphic for final presentation

Finalize multimodal model to incorporate pretrained text classification
-   Incorporate additional datasets and align emotions to SER
-   Literature review of best pretrained models
-   Compare to best SER audio only model

Streamlit presentation
-   Comparison of SER audio only models
-   Comparison of best audio only model to multimodal model
-   Demonstration with 1-2 audio files (take audio file as input?)

Final report
-   Summarize model architectures for custom SER models
-   Summarize literature review for text classification
-   Summarize model performances
